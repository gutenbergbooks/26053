<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>PART I</h2>

<h2>WHY IS THE GLOBE?</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE CREATION</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 14em;">
    <em>Six busy days it took in all</em><br />
    <em>To make a World and plan its fall,</em><br />
    <em>The seventh, SOMEONE said &#8217;twas good</em><br />
    <em>And rested, should you think he could?</em><br />
    <em>Knowing what the result would be</em><br />
    <em>There would have been no rest for me!</em><br />
                         <span style="margin-left: 12em;"><em>Claire Beecher Kummer.</em></span></p>


<p>It takes much longer to write a Geography than, according to Moses, it
took to create the World which it is the Geographer&#8217;s business to
describe; and since the Critic has been added to the list of created
beings, it is no longer the fashion for the Author to pass judgment on
his own work.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Let us imagine, however, that concealed in the cargo of Hypothetic
Nebula destined for the construction of the Terrestrial Globe was a
Protoplasmic Stowaway that sprang to being in the shape of a Critic just
as the work of Creation was finished.</p>

<p>Would it not be interesting to speculate upon that Critic&#8217;s reception of
the freshly made World?</p>

<p>We may be sure that he would have found many things not to his liking;
technical defects such as the treatment of grass and foliage in green
instead of the proper purple; the tinting of the sky which any landscape
painter will tell you would be more decorative done in turquoise green
than cobalt blue.</p>

<p>Like the foolish Butterfly in the Talmud, who (to impress Mrs.
Butterfly) stamped his tiny foot upon the dome of King Solomon&#8217;s Temple,
our Critic might have declared the World &ldquo;Too flimsy in construction.&rdquo;
He would certainly have found fault with the Solar System and the
Plumbing&mdash;the absence of heat in Winter when there is the greater need
of it and the paucity of moisture in the desert places where it never
rains.</p>

<p>The comicality of the Ape family might
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
have provoked a reluctant
smile, but much more likely a lecture on the impropriety of descending
to caricature in a serious work.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST CALENDAR</h3>

<p class="center">The Creation of Heaven &amp; Earth <em>in Six dayes</em> <em>Gen: I</em></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 371px;">
<img src="images/img17.png" width="371" height="600" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>At best, our Critic would have pronounced the freshly made World the
work of a beginner, conceding perhaps that he &ldquo;showed promise&rdquo; and
&ldquo;might go far,&rdquo; and if he wished to be very impressive indeed, he would
pretend that he had penetrated the veil of Anonymity and hint darkly
that he detected evident traces of a Feminine Touch!</p>

<p>In that, however, our Critic would only have been anticipating, for is
there not at this very moment on the press a Suffrage edition (for women
only) of the Rubaiyat, in which one verse is amended to read thus&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 13em;">
    <em>The ball no question makes of Ayes or Nos,</em><br />
    <em>But right or left, as strikes the Player goes,</em><br />
    <em>And SHE who tossed it down into the field,</em><br />
    <em>SHE knows about it all, SHE knows, SHE knows!</em></p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<h2><em>STRICTLY PRIVATE</em></h2>

<p class="center"><strong><em>For the Reader Only</em></strong></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Reader</span>:</p>

<p>This is for <em>you</em>, and you only. We have concealed it between chapters
one and two so that it will not meet any eye but yours.</p>

<p>We have a confession to make&mdash;it would be useless to attempt
concealment&mdash;we have the Digression habit.</p>

<p>We have tried every known remedy but we fear it is incurable.</p>

<p>All we ask, Gentle Reader, is that when we stray too far you will favour
us with a gentle reminder.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>A LONG JUMP</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img20.png" width="400" height="230" alt="image" title="" />
</div>


<p>It is a long jump from Moses, the author of the first work on Geography,
to Peter Simple.</p>

<p>When the acrobatic reader has fetched his breath and looks back at the
fearsome list of Geographers he has skipped&mdash;Strabo, Anaximander,
Hecat&oelig;us, Dem&oelig;ritus, Eudoxus, Ephorus, Dic&oelig;archus,
Erastothenes, Polybius, Posidonius and Charles F. King,&mdash;he may well be
thankful to find he has fallen upon his feet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
The Geographer&#8217;s task is endless.</p>

<p>The Planet he endeavours to portray is perpetually changing its
appearance. After thousands and thousands of years, it is no nearer
completion than it was in the beginning.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/img21.png" width="344" height="400" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Sea with its white teeth bites the edges of the continents into new
shapes, as a child bites the edges of a biscuit. The glaciers file away
the mountains into valleys and plains. Beneath the ocean busy insects
are building<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the foundations of new continents and, under the earth,
Fiery Demons are ready at all times to burst forth and help to destroy
the old ones.</p>

<p>It really begins to look as if this Planet would never be finished.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of his geography, Moses tells us there were only
two people in the world.</p>

<p>Today we are preparing to put up the &ldquo;standing room only&rdquo; notice. In
another thousand years, for aught we know, the earth may be going round
dark and tenantless and bearing the sign &ldquo;To Let.&rdquo; What does it matter
to us? What are we but microscopic weevils in the mouldy crust of earth?
Sufficient unto the day is the weevil thereof.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>THE GIDDY GLOBE</strong></p>


<p>Men of Science, who delight in applying harsh terms to things that
cannot talk back, have called this Giddy Globe an Oblate Spheroid.</p>

<p>Francis Bacon called it a Bubble; Shakespeare, an Oyster; Rossetti, a
Midge; and W. S. Gilbert addresses it familiarly as a Ball&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 14em;">
    <em>Roll on, thou ball, roll on!</em><br />
    <em>Through pathless realms of Space</em><br />
          <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><em>Roll on!</em></span><br />
    <em>What though I&#8217;m in a sorry case?</em><br />
    <em>What though I cannot meet my bills?</em><br />
    <em>What though I suffer toothache&#8217;s ills?</em><br />
    <em>What though I swallow countless pills?</em><br />
          <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><em>Never you mind</em></span><br />
          <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><em>Roll on!</em></span><br />
                <span style="margin-left: 6em;">(<em>It rolls on.</em>)</span></p>

<p>But these people belong to a privileged class that is encouraged (even
paid) to distort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the language, and they must not be taken too literally.</p>

<p>The Giddy Globe is really quite large, not to say obese.</p>

<p>Her waist measurement is no less than twenty-five thousand miles. In the
hope of reducing it, the earth takes unceasing and violent exercise, but
though she spins round on one toe at the rate of a thousand miles an
hour every day, and round the sun once a year, she does not succeed in
taking off a single mile or keeping even comfortably warm all over.</p>

<p>No wonder the globe is giddy!</p>


<h3><em>QUESTIONS</em></h3>

<p><em>Explain the Nebular Hypothesis.</em></p>

<p><em>State briefly the electromagnetical constituents of the Aurora
Borealis, and explain their relation to the Hertzian Waves.</em></p>

<p><em>Define the difference between the Hertzian Wave and the Marcel Wave.</em></p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE USE OF THE GLOBE</strong></p>


<p>What is the Earth for? Nobody knows. Some say the Earth was made to
supply the wants of Man, but as Man is part and parcel of the Earth
herself, dust of her dust, mould of her mould, it does not answer the
question.</p>

</div>
<p style="margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;">From an instantaneous photograph of animal cracker.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;">Owing to the high price of living the cow was partially eaten by the
author before the photograph could be taken.</p>


<p>To be sure the Earth produces the Tobacco
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Plant, and many other things

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 228px;">
<img src="images/img28.png" width="228" height="250" alt="image" title="" />
</div>


<p>The Earth is self-centred. Poised on an imaginary toe, she pirouettes
round her self-centre, at the rate of over a thousand miles an hour.</p>

<p>We say imaginary toe because the Earth, owing to the enormous size of
her waist, has never been able to see it.</p>

<p>To anyone with a waist measurement of twenty-five thousand miles the
very existence of toes is purely problematical.</p>

<p>To wear an actual belt round a waist of such dimensions would be
impossible even if it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
could be of any use. Instead, therefore, the
Earth wears round her middle an imaginary line called the Equator.</p>

<p>To give this imaginary belt some excuse for existence we have depicted
the Earth in an imaginary ballet skirt, which without in any way
hampering her movements complies with the strict regulations pertaining
to feminine attire.</p>

<p>Being self-centred, the Earth has naturally an exaggerated sense of
self-esteem.</p>

<p>Other Spheres of equal or greater importance are referred to as
&ldquo;Luminaries&rdquo; and supposed to exist chiefly for the purpose of furnishing
light when the Sun and Moon are otherwise engaged.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 14em;">
    <em>Oh would some Power the giftie gie her</em><br />
    <em>To see, as other Planets see her!</em></p>


<h3><em>QUESTIONS</em></h3>

<p><em>Can an imaginary line be said to exist?</em></p>

<p class="center"><strong>THE EARTH&#8217;S CRUST</strong></p>


<p>Matter-of-fact Geologists speak of the Earth&#8217;s Crust as if there were
only one Crust.</p>

<p>Thoughtful people (like ourselves) who can read between imaginary lines,
know that there are (as in a pie) two Crusts, the Upper Crust and the
Under Crust.</p>

<p>The Upper Crust is pleasantly situated on the top and is rich and
agreeable and much sought after.</p>

<p>The Under Crust is soggy and disagreeable. The only apparent reason for
its existence is to hold up the Upper Crust.</p>

<p>To quote the eminent Nonsensologist Gelett Burgess&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
    <em>The Upper Crust is light as snow</em><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>And gay with sugar-rime;</em></span><br />
    <em>The Under Crust must stay below,</em><br />
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>It has a horrid time.</em></span></p>

<p>When in the course of time the Upper Crust becomes too rich and heavy
for the popular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
taste, the Social Pie flops over and the Under Crust
becomes the Upper Crust.</p>

<p>These periodic flip-flops of the Social Pie are called Revolutions.</p>

<p>You would think that a Revolving Pie would be a disturbing thing to have
in one&#8217;s system, but the Giddy Globe doesn&#8217;t seem to mind it in the
least.</p>

<p>Balanced on an imaginary toe, she continues to pirouette at the rate of
a thousand miles an hour, just as if nothing were the matter.</p>

<p>The latest specimen of Acrobatic Pastry is after a Russian recipe.</p>

<p>The Bolshevik Pie has no Upper Crust at all and is declared by the
leading Chefs of Europe to be unfit for human consumption, but the proof
of the Pie is in the eating, how would you like to try just a&mdash;&mdash;*</p>

</div>


<p>In spite of incessant and violent exercise, the Giddy Globe (as we have
remarked before) is unable to keep comfortably warm all over.</p>

<p>Her Temperature varies from intense cold at her upper and lower
extremities to fever heat in the region of her equatorial diaphragm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Ancient Geographers indicated these variations of temperature by means
of <em>Zones</em>.</p>

<p>The Term Zone is derived from the Greek word
<ins class="translit" title="Greek: z&ocirc;n&ecirc;">&#950;&#969;&#957;&#951;</ins> a Belt or
Girdle, and a Girdle in the days of the First Geography Book was the
principal (if not the only) garment of a well dressed person.</p>

<p>Today, however, the Girdle is no longer accepted as a complete costume.</p>

<p>No modern Costumer would countenance such a &ldquo;model,&rdquo; it would be too
easy to copy and consequently unprofitable.</p>

<p>Even the &ldquo;Knee-plus-ultra&rdquo; of Newport or Palm Beach Society would
hesitate to pose for the Sunday Supplement Photographer in a one-piece
Bathing Girdle.</p>

<p>You might explore the World of Dress, from the Land of the Midnight
Follies to the Uttermost parts of Greenwich Village and find nothing
exactly like it.</p>

<p>It is on its way, to be sure, but it will never be fashionable until&mdash;</p>

    <em>The two extremes of d&eacute;collet&eacute;</em><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Why, then, in this up-to-date Geography Book, should we depict the Giddy
Globe in an obsolete hoop skirt of imaginary Zones?</p>

<p>In striving to answer the question, we have hit upon a pleasing
compromise.</p>

<p>Some people are sensitive about their ages. The Giddy Globe has never
told us hers.</p>

<p>Rude men of science, after careful examination, declare she can&#8217;t be a
day under five billion years old.</p>

<p>Theologians, ever tactful in feminine matters, set her down as a
shrinking young thing of barely four thousand summers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Real delicacy of feeling goes with the bulging tum rather than with the
bulging forehead; who ever saw a thin Bishop or a fat man of science!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 13em;">
    <em>Happy the man with the bulging Tum,</em><br />
    <em>Who smiles and smiles and is never glum!&mdash;</em><br />
    <em>But alas for the man with the bulging brow,</em><br />
    <em>If he wanted to smile, he wouldn&#8217;t know how!</em></p>

<p>If the Giddy Globe asked <em>us</em> to guess her age, we should say, without a
moment&#8217;s hesitation, &ldquo;Whatever it is you certainly don&#8217;t look it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Astronomers may say what they like, a Planet is as old as it looks,
especially if it is a Lady-Planet, and we have seen ours when she didn&#8217;t
look a June day over sixteen! and, not having a bulging forehead, we
told her so!</p>

<p>Astronomers think themselves so wise, but what do they know about the
sex of the Planets?</p>

<p>With the exception of Mother Earth and old Sol Ph&oelig;bus,&mdash;nothing!</p>

<p>If you asked an Astronomer whether the Pleiad girls were really the
daughters of Atlas, or what Jupiter was doing with eight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> Moons (if they
<em>were</em> Moons), he would think you were trifling with him.</p>

<p>But is it not possible that the old Greek tales were the garbled gossip
of an age-forgotten science of which we have only the A.B.C.?</p>

<p>If it is Love that makes the world go round (and who can prove that it
isn&#8217;t?), what makes the other Planets go round?</p>

<p>How about the movements of the Heavenly Bodies?</p>

<p>How about&mdash;&mdash;*</p>

<p style="margin-left: 32em; font-size: smaller;">

<p>There are no good photographs of the Giddy Globe; she refuses to sit.</p>

spends her time pirouetting round in a circle with all her might and
main.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is to avoid the photographer that the Earth spins, and not
merely to reduce her girth as we hinted elsewhere.</p>

<p>In these days such a strenuous evasion of publicity is suspicious.</p>

<p>Where does she come from?</p>

<p>Where is she going?</p>

<p>She refuses to answer, she will not even state her business or tell her
real name.</p>

<p>For &aelig;ons (quite a number of &aelig;ons) this Giddy one has been going round
under various male and female aliases such as&mdash;Cosmos, Mother Earth, The

<p class="center"><strong>CLIMATE AND WEATHER</strong></p>


<p>Climate is a Theory. Weather is a condition.</p>

<p>Or, to make it clearer to the reader, Climate is a Hypothesis and
Weather is a <em>Reductio ad Absurdum</em>. This explains why it invariably
snows for the first time in years whenever one goes to California.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/img44.png" width="150" height="144" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>What is the Weather for?</p>

<p>Everything in Nature is designed to contribute to the needs or pleasures
of Mankind.</p>

<p>From the tree of the forest we get the wood from which the nutmeg is
made, the wood-alcohol for our Scotch high-ball and the pulp for our
newspaper, which, in turn, is transmuted to leather for the soles of our
soldiers&#8217; boots.</p>

<p>From the sands of the sea we make sugar for sweetening our coffee&mdash;that
mysterious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
beverage, the secret of whose manufacture has never been
revealed.</p>

<p>From the cotton plant comes the woolen under-garment and the soldier&#8217;s
blanket.</p>

<p>From the lowly cabbage springs the Havana Perfecto, with its gold and
crimson band, and from the simple turnip is distilled the golden
champagne, without which so many lives will now be empty.</p>

<p>Even the humble straw has its uses&mdash;to indicate the trend of the air
current and for the stuffing of the life-preserver.</p>

<p>What then is the use of the Weather?</p>

<p>Supposing you have made a globe and put some people upon it to live.
What would you do to make them feel at home?</p>

<p>You would give them something to talk about.</p>

<p>Just so&mdash;the Weather was designed to furnish a universal topic of
conversation for Man.</p>

<p>Without the Weather, 999,999 out of 1,000,000 conversations would die in
their infancy.</p>

<p>In the first geography book we learn from Moses how and of what the
Weather was made.</p>

<p>Since then, nothing has been so much talked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
about as the Weather, and in nothing has so little advance been made.</p>


<h3><em>QUESTIONS</em></h3>

<p><em>Is it notoriety that makes the Weather-Vane?</em></p>

<p><em>Where does the Winter-Resort in Summer? And why?</em></p>

<p><em>How many litres of champagne can be extracted from the cube-root of one
turnip?</em></p>

<p><em>What did the Weather do to get herself so talked about?</em></p>

<p>In the first geography we are told of a young married couple who were
cast into the world for a pomological error on their part, about 4000
B.C.</p>

<p>Some seventeen centuries later, the world was lost sight of in a deluge.</p>

<p>It was re-discovered by a navigator named Noah who, though barely six
hundred years old, was the commander of a sea-going menagerie.</p>

<p>Commander Noah, after cruising about for twelve months and ten days,
landed from his zo&ouml;logical water-wagon upon a precipitous Asiatic Jag
called Ararat on the twenty-seventh of February, 2300 B.C.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>THE HABITABLE GLOBE</strong></p>


<p>The term &ldquo;Habitable Globe&rdquo; was doubtless invented by some Celestial
Humorist who had never visited this planet.</p>

<p>People live on it, to be sure, but they have no choice. There is nowhere
else to live.</p>

<p>The Giddy Globe ...*</p>

<p style="margin-left: 32em; font-size: smaller;">
    * Isn&#8217;t it about time to drop this<br />
      personal simile?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;"><em>The Reader.</em></span></p>

<p>... Quite so. Suppose we consider the Globe as an Apartment House.</p>

<p>We are told it was finished in six days. No wonder it is faultily
constructed.</p>

<p>The Heating Apparatus is out of date. The apartments nearest to the
Radiator are insufferably hot, those farthest away unbearably cold, and
those between too changeable for comfort.</p>

<p>The Water Supply is unreliable. In some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
apartments, great numbers perish every year from thirst.</p>

<p>In the cellar there is a munition factory where, in defiance of
regulations, there are stored High Explosives. These blow up from time
to time, causing great damage and loss of life among the tenants.</p>

<p>The janitor is a disobliging old person who has been there since the
house was started and holds his job, in spite of incessant complaints.
When asked to hurry, he fairly crawls and, when people want him most to
stay, nothing can stop him.</p>

<p>His name is Tempus.</p>

<p>The first tenants (as before stated) were a young couple who had been
compelled to leave a more luxurious apartment because children were not
allowed, though animals of all kinds, even snakes, were tolerated.</p>

<p>On the whole, the Globe is anything but a model Apartment House. Each
family considers itself the only respectable one in the building and
they are constantly squabbling for the possession of the most desirable
rooms.</p>

<p>The tenants of the different stories, originally of one colour, have
been tanned according to their proximity to the Solar Stove. They come
in five shades of fast colours&mdash;Black, Brown, Yellow, Red and
White,&mdash;the White being farthest away from the Stove.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
There are also some brighter colours, which are not guaranteed,&mdash;varying
from the chromatic discord of the post-impressionist Savage to the
delicate rose-pink of the Perfect Lady.</p>

<p>This last is the most delectable of all&mdash;but, alas, it is the one that
fades most quickly.</p>

<p>Each Family, however, thinks that his own particular shade is the only
fitting one for the Perfect Human Being.</p>

<p>To that end he spends a large part of his time in scheming how to get
rid of all the other tints.</p>

<p>All of which is a great waste of centuries! Old Tempus the Janitor has
always settled the Tint question with his Solar Stove and always will.</p>

<p>A week at the seashore in August ought to convince anyone of the
efficiency of the Solar Tint Factory. In the tan of the surf bather
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> is
locked up the secret of Race Colouration.</p>

(with the assistance of Mr. Marconi and Mr. Rolls H. Royce and a few
others) will bring the Race Families into such close relationship that
they will eventually be all blended into one harmonious Neutral Tint!</p>

<p>A pale mauve World! One tint, one religion, one food, one dress, one
Drink, one everything.</p>

<p>How appalling! And think of the moment when it is to be decided once and

    <em>That they should take who have the power</em><br />
    <em>And they should keep who can.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>In every community on Earth, the strongest, the craftiest or the
wealthiest of the male inhabitants conspire to compel their weaker,
stupider or poorer brothers and sisters to pay them for the privilege of
remaining on earth.</p>

<p>Government by the Strongest is called an Absolute Monarchy.</p>

<p>Government by the Craftiest, a Limited Monarchy.</p>

<p>Government by the Wealthiest, a Republic.</p>

<p>In an Absolute Monarchy, the People are Controlled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
In a Limited Monarchy, they are Cajoled.</p>

<p>In a Republic, they are Sold.</p>

<p>For the successful operation of Limited Monarchies and Republics, it is
necessary to delude the Common People into the belief that they are
managing their own affairs.</p>

<p>According to Moses, the First Geographer, Immorality is an heirloom

<p>Men of Science, on the other hand, declare it to be merely the
psycho-neurotic reaction of climatic environment on the celliferous

<p>In other words, Vice is nothing more than Virtue outside of its natural

<p>This is clearly set forth in the accompanying Moral Map of the World in

<p>The Earth has three kinds of Poles, the Frigid Poles in the North and
South and the very hot Poles in the centre of Europe.</p>

<p>This chapter is about the North Pole.</p>

<p>The North Pole is the Geographical interrogation point of the Earth.</p>

<p>It is probably the only absolutely moral spot in the World.</p>

<p>Scientists declare it to be the site of the Garden of Eden, thus giving
colour to the popular notion that Eden was the original Roof Garden.</p>

<p>The only language that has ever been spoken at the North Pole is
English.</p>

<p>The language that Lieutenant Peary used when he found the footprint of
Doctor Cook on the Pole, whatever else it might be, was English, and the
language of the next
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>

footprint of Lieutenant Peary, will probably be English too.</p>

<img src="images/img66.png" width="269" height="400" alt="image" title="" />

<p>Whatever use may be ultimately found for the North Pole, up to the
present time it has only been used for advertising purposes.</p>

<p>The frozen tracts that surround it bear the names of Adventurers,
Princes and Editors, and the very topmost tip, out of compliment to a
well-known pianist and politician, has been called the Magnetic Pole.</p>

<p>Let us see America first.</p>

<p>On a modern map of the Western Hemisphere America is as easy to see as
the Decorations on the breast of a Rear Admiral of a Dry Dock.</p>

<p>One wonders how it escaped being discovered so long!</p>

<p>But when you look at this map of the Western Hemisphere as it appeared
about a thousand years ago, when Lief Ericsen discovered New England,
you will understand that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
discovering America in those days was no child&#8217;s play.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Lief, the son of Eric, did not think much of his find.</p>

<p>How could a lowbrowed viking be expected to understand Boston, much less
what was going to be Boston in a thousand years!</p>

<img src="images/img71.png" width="338" height="300" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">Early Map of the Western Hemisphere</span>
</div>

<p>After writing his Impressions of America in obscure Runes on a
conspicuous rock, Lief pulled up his anchor and sailed home to Norway.</p>

<p>No one could decipher the Runes, but everybody suspected what they
meant.</p>

<p>And Lief was justly punished for his rudeness, his statue stands (so
runs the tale) in the Fenway of Boston to this day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
America was not discovered again for nearly five hundred years.</p>

<p>Then Christopher Columbus took a hand, but though he made four trips to
the New World, Columbus carelessly neglected to write a book or even a
magazine article on his Impressions of America.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;">

<p>A new path in Navigation, just as in Art or Literature, once shown, is
easy to follow, and seven years later an Italian plagiarist named
Amerigo discovered America all over again and copyrighted the whole
continent in his own name.</p>

<p>By this time, as the accompanying map will show, the continent of
America had gained considerably in bulk and offered an easy mark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> to the
horde of discoverers who came in the wake of Amerigo.</p>

<p>And still they come&mdash;and though it is too late to secure a copyright on
the continent they never fail to copyright their impressions of
America.</p>

<p>In spite of many laudable attempts, America was never seriously

named Ibid, but what does a poet&#8217;s name matter except to his creditors?</p>

<p>Canada, with the exception of Mexico, is the only part of North America
not ruled by the Irish.</p>

<p>In former days it was a popular Health Resort for frenzied financiers
who wished to retire from private life.</p>

<p>It is now a still more popular resort for Americans suffering from
thirst.</p>

<p>Though next door neighbours and rivals in business and, what is still
more trying, near relatives, Canada and the United States are the best
of friends.</p>

<p>For over a hundred years there has not been so much as a picket-fence or
a policeman, much less a patrol or a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
fortification, on the border line between the two countries.</p>

<p>Canada has not, like her sister Columbia, &ldquo;severed home ties&rdquo;; she is
perfectly happy under the parental roof, earns her own living, has a
latch key and stays out as late as she pleases and has never been able
to understand &ldquo;why girls leave home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though differing in many respects, the United States and Canada have so
much in common and are so nearly of the same age and size that, in any
musical comedy of Nations, the two might easily pass for a &ldquo;sister
turn.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The inhabitants of Canada are the most Moral and Patriotic people in the
World, and their army is second to none in bravery and won the World
War.</p>

<p>But a Country must not be judged by its size.</p>

<p>The Planet Jupiter is twelve times as large as this Giddy Globe of ours,

<p>In every quarter of the globe they have planted seeds of self-government
which today are blossoming into an English-Speaking Union under the
British and American Flags that embrace one-fourth of the surface of the
earth.</p>

<p>The climate of England is temperate. Its air is not, like that of the
United States, compared to champagne.</p>

<p>London, the capital, is famous for its fogs; this is due to the absence
of Sky-Scrapers.</p>

<p>London is also the centre of that vicious heritage of the Victorian Era,
Respectability.</p>

<p>For any enjoyable degree of latitude, the Londoner must go to Paris,
Vienna or Buda Pesth and other capitals, which in return take

<p>Ireland is the land of the Irish Bull, a paradoxical Bovine whose
cross-eyed horns can toss a British commonplace in two directions at
once.</p>

<p>The population of Ireland consists chiefly of Absentee landlords and
Emigrants to the United States.</p>

<p>They are ruled by two Absentee governments, a Parliament at Westminster
and an Itinerant President.</p>

The country is infested with Absentee Snakes. It is believed that the
Serpent who tempted Eve (from the &ldquo;way he had with the women&rdquo;) was one
of these Absentee snakes.</p>

<p>Strabo, the Greek Geographer who visited Ireland long before St.
Patrick, describes the inhabitants as, &ldquo;<em>more savage than the Britons,
feeding on human flesh and enormous eaters, deeming it commendable to
devour their deceased fathers</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strabo evidently attended a wake and miscalculated the strength of the
national beverage.</p>

<p>The principal products of Ireland are Potatoes, Pugilists,
Patriots,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
Poteen and Bernard Shaw.</p>

<p>Wales is the home of the Welsh bards so called because the language in

Celtic and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Chocktaw, is <em>barred</em> from the concert and operatic stage.</p>

<p>The most famous products of Wales are the Welsh Rabbit, the Prince of
Wales and Lloyd George.</p>

<p>The Welsh Rabbit, born in a chafing dish and prolific as his namesake of
Australia, has spread all over the Giddy Globe and been a potent factor
in keeping the world awake.</p>

<p>Lloyd George too (strange parallel!) was born in a political chafing
dish and has been an even more powerful factor in keeping the world
awake.</p>

<p>Let us hope that the Prince of Wales (Bless him) will follow in the
footsteps of this illustrious pair and live to keep the world awake long
after this Geography has gone into its hundred thousandth edition!</p>

<p>The Prince has been immortalized in the following lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">

            <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><em>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo;</em></span><br />

     <em>Oh, think of the Prince of Wales!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
    <em>&ldquo;But, Kitten,&rdquo; I cried, dismayed,</em><br />
    <em>&ldquo;If you live through the angry gales</em><br />
     <em>You know you will be afraid</em><br />

<p>They were seemingly inseparable.</p>

<p>The first indication that everything was not as it should be with this
long united couple, was in the year 1880, when a Frenchman named De
Lesseps (who had already succeeded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
in divorcing Asia and Africa) attempted to bring about a separation.</p>

<p>The attempt, however, was a failure, and, after dragging on for eight
years, proceedings were dropped for want of funds.</p>

<p>Fourteen years later President Roosevelt, desiring to remove all
obstacles to a much desired union of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
started a new action for divorce on the same grounds as that of De
Lesseps, and in August, 1902, the divorce of North and South America and
the wedding of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans were simultaneously
celebrated.</p>

<p>The Northern and Southern continents are now better friends than ever
and the Atlantic Ocean no longer has to sneak round by the back door to
spend an evening with the Pacific.</p>

<p>The Dutch are the cleanest people in the world. So deep-seated is Dutch
cleanliness that Godliness (in the next seat) must get up and cling to a
strap.</p>

<p>In Holland they run cleanliness into the ground, the heads of the
cabbages are inspected every day and the ears of the corn and the necks
of the bottles scrubbed regularly every Saturday night.</p>

useful task.</p>

<p>And the Sea! The majestic Sea, that has always boasted of its freedom,
is locked up in Dykes and forced to do the work of highways and
railroads.</p>

<p>The capital of Holland is the Hague, and here was held the first Peace
Conference (in 1898), a gathering of Autocrats and Plutocrats to discuss
the Economics of War.</p>

<p><em>Firstly</em>, to make rules by which war may be conducted with the least
possible damage to Vested Interests.</p>

<p><em>Secondly</em>, to reduce the cost of war by the use of methods which, while
putting a soldier out of action, will not injure him beyond the
possibility of repair for use in another War.</p>

<p>Today the Peace Palace is to let and Andrew Carnegie, who built it, is
dead, but another Conference (called by Woodrow Wilson) is to be held in
Geneva which, Peter Simple hopes, will abolish War forever.</p>

with those of the Russian Dancers.</p>

the well-known Steps to Avernus, which are for descent only&mdash;and easy at

<p>It is all very sad about Norway and Sweden! A handsomer country
couple&mdash;or couple of countries&mdash;it would be hard to meet anywhere, and
so propinquous! Have they not been next-door neighbours from the infancy
of the world?</p>

<p>And everybody knows what Propinquity does.</p>

<p>It is Cupid&#8217;s middle name; what more natural than that they should get
married?</p>

<p>Haven&#8217;t you heard? Well, it all happened so quickly, they were married
in Vienna in 1815, and&mdash;well, you know Propinquity is the Devil&#8217;s middle
name, too&mdash;they were divorced in 1905 after a brief married life of only
ninety years!</p>

<p>What could have been the trouble?</p>

was both. Here is a typical Scandinavian Menu&mdash;</p>

<p>China is known as the Flowery Kingdom. It is the most exclusive

<p>The only Flower that succeeds in climbing the high wall is the little
flower of Pekoe and her sisters who leave their Porcelain Paradise to
cheer without inebriating the dull people of the outside world.</p>

<p>The country of China, too, may be likened to a Flower; her treasure is
the envy of the world, and flower-like she must remain rooted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> to the
ground while the Busy Bees from other lands relieve her of everything
she possesses.</p>

<p>Everyone agrees that China should have an Open Door, but the Busy Bee
Nations want a Door that opens only inwards, while the Flower Nation
wants a door that opens only outwards.</p>

<p>At a recent conference of Bees and Flowers, Peter Simple suggested a
Revolving Door as a compromise.</p>

<p>A commission was at once appointed by President Chu Chin Chow to report
on Revolving Doors.</p>

<p>No work on Geography could be called complete without a description of
these six (counting, etc.) countries.</p>

<p>If the Reader should ask me how I came to leave six such important
countries to the last page, I should be compelled to change the subject.</p>

<p>Writing a little Geography Book is like packing a very small bag for a
journey round the world, only instead of cramming it with shirts and
shoes and collars and handkerchiefs and brushes, you stuff it full of
countries, and when you try to close it (as with the bag) you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> always
find that you have left out at least several of the most important
things.</p>

<p>No amount of squeezing (or sitting on the lid) will make room for six
such big countries in a little book that is already as full as it can
be.</p>

<p>The only thing to do is to take out all the countries and lay them in a
row and see which you can get along best without; you can&#8217;t possibly
spare any of the large countries; the question is how many of the little
countries together would&mdash;&mdash;*</p>
